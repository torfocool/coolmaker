Adding +assetsystem to sbox_game
move content\sbox to game\sbox_src
move content/core to game/core_src
Asset system content is in *_src instead of ../content/*
Path Fixups
Material editing works with new *_src paths
Rust addon
Changing default console port (vconsole fucks with it)
Resource Compiler, compile to the right folder when addon
I'm going to assume we don't need all this readonly shit
Load asset info again
material editor, hammer working with addons and addon *_src
Citizen addon
Colours
Don't mark mod paths as read only
ModIsVisibleToAsset always returns true
Allow loading from any "mod" in hammer
Lets treat any files ending with _c as lfs
citizen skin
lfs
Fixed model editor
Fix SkipToModRelativePathFromGameOrContentRelativePath in fileutils to work with our layout
Add ignore tools_thumbnail_cache.bin
SetModGameSubdir - skip the logic, always set it to sbox
Fixed IsAddon logic being backwards in ComputeOutputFileName
Local lightmap compilation is assumed
Properly close clr host on shutdown
Remove material debug
FileSystem:AddAddonsSearchPaths (review this later)
Hammer map target location fix
Fixed CResourceCompilerContext::ContentPathToFullPath for new layout
if we're compiling in %temp% then don't treat as an addon because the paths will be all fucky
Call AddAddonsSearchPaths in standalone resourcecompiler.exe
CResourceCompilerPathScope - don't limit/remove search paths - we don't give a fuck about that shit
ComputeVpkName can be a shit ton simpler
